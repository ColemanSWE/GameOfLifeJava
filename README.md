# GameOfLifeJava
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java. 

## Notes 
I realized a bit later after researching Java more deeply that I shouldn't have put Simulation.java in a default package and should instead have named it something similar to `com.colemanswe` for example. I'm just hesitant to refactor now in fear of breaking things a lot.
